Normally, the remote address and port is assigned randomly each time you start a TCP
tunnel. For production services (and convenience) you often want a stable, guaranteed
remote address. To do this, first, log in to your ngrok.com dashboard and click
"Reserve Address" in the "Reserved TCP Addresses" section. Then use the -remote-addr
option when invoking ngrok to bind a tunnel on your reserved TCP address. Make sure
the -region you specify matches the region in which you reserved your address.

Bind a TCP tunnel on a reserved remote address
ngrok tcp --region=us --remote-addr 1.tcp.ngrok.io:12345 22
